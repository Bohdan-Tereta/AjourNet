Ajour
=====
##Introduction

Ajour Sysytem was created in order to automate collaborative process of BTs organisation at Ericpol Ukraine involving Line Managers,
Business Trip managers, Accountants, Director and Control specialists – totally 18 persons.
A team of 6 Junior Software Developers had months of invaluable experience working at this project and learning at the same time.

For requesting BTs or exchanging organizational data there is no need to send out e-mails with bulky attachments anymore.
All information is accessible online. LMs request BTs in a few clicks, BT managers make habitation, invitation and flights data, accountants plan funds and an employee receives BT details by e-mail.
BT process participants have convenient access to BTs history, statuses of passports, visas and work permits.
On return from BT system helps an employee to fill financial report properly.
Lately Ajour has been extended to track employee absences.


A few words from Ajour System Users:

> "Czytelne, nieskomplikowane i przyjemne w użytkowaniu narzędzie do trackingu podróży służbowych. Z powodzeniem wykorzystuję je w swojej codziennej pracy."

Monika Gabriel-Kwitniewska, Analysis and Control Specialist, Krakow


> "First of all it is transparent, good looking and contains many aspects. Everyone has assigned unit in Poland, and some of them line manager in Poland - it is important for me. I can see implementation delegation's phase so it is more useful than BTtrack."

Katarzyna Torunska, Personnel Assistant, Łódź

> “I have used Ajour when organizing last BT of my department employees. BT process has become simpler. Instead of sending 2-3 e-mails and filling a spreadsheet it’s now enough just to fill a simple form. It’s very convenient. Besides Ajour has usefull information like passport and visa availability, number of used days and other. Generally I think that Ajour System has made BT organization much simpler.”
