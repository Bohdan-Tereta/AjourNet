### Welcome!

Here are a few steps needed to start contributing to the Project.

*Discussion for this document can be found [here](https://github.com/EricpolUkraine/Ajour/issues/11)*

* Get familiar with GitHub and our workflow
* Setup development environment
* Get familiar with project documentation

### Get familiar with GitHub and our workflow
1. Create a GitHub account using your private e-mail so that you can communicate with collaborators being out of office.
2. Send your account name to the Project Maintainer (tmandzak@gmail.com) so that he can add you to the Project Team
3. Have a look at [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/), especially at
 * [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
 * [Using pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) (we use Fork&pull development model)
 * [Creating a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
 * [Syncing a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork)
 * [Writing on GitHub](https://help.github.com/categories/88/articles)
 * [Be Social](https://help.github.com/articles/be-social)
4. Tasks are added by adding Issues that can be discussed by all contributors. Project Maintainer (PM) assigns labelsto reflect its priority. Author of an Issue can place his proposal of label at the end of issue title in square brackets, for ex.: "Create button is not clickable [bug]".
5. Currently our workflow looks as follows:
  * Fork a repository
  * Sync forked repository 
  * Choose an issue and inform others making a comment
  * Make a dedicated branch 
  * Make a commit -> Make a pull request to 'development' branch -> Take part in a discussion ->
    Make additional commits to a dedicated branch if needed (opened pull request is updated automatically)
  * Pull request is closed by Maintainer (merge or cancel)  
  * Issue is marked as 'done' after the pull request is merged and its number is specified in comment
  * Pre-release is created based on 'done' issues
  * Only pre-release can be deployed to Test Server
  * Issue is closed after it's tested on Test Server and successfull test status is placed in comment
  * Pull request for merging successfully tested pre-release on 'development' branch to 'master' is created by PM
  * Release is created after pull request is merged to 'master'
  * Release commit can be deployed to Production Server 
6. Important! In our project we use UTF-8 encoding for files, so if you create/edit files that contain non-unicode characters, save your file in UTF-8 encoding. 

(to be updated - it's only current best thinking)
